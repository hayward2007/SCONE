## Abstract
This paper proposes the development of a six-legged robot capable of
rotational motion, with the aim of exploring its efficiency in navigating steep terrain
and stairs. Furthermore, this paper seeks to evaluate the driving speed and energy
efficiency of existing truck-type delivery robots. The rise of delivery robots as a
replacement of CO-emitting motorcycles has prompted major companies to
explore new options for delivery agents. However, most of the delivery robots
currently being used are four- or six-wheeled trucks that face limitations in crossing
obstacles such as high-rise stairs or curb stones. This project aims to develop
SCONE as a solution to such obstacles. To implement SCONE, Parallel Link
Mechanism was utilized for efficient usage of actuators and enabling walking, and
Arc-shaped Wheels with a center angle of 240¬∞ were attached to each end of the
leg for driving. When powered by a battery, SCONE was unable to maintain an idle
position or perform any movements. Although this was solved by powering SCONE
with an external power source showing the walking speed of 0.5ùëö/ùë† and the
driving speed of 0.7ùëö/ùë† , motor overload occurred during rotational motion and
climbing stars. Furthermore, slipping occurred while climbing steep terrain. This
was caused by insufficient friction between the Arc-shaped Wheel and the test
environment, on account of the low torque of the actuator caused motor overload.
To address the issues at hand, it is recommended to eliminate the inefficient
Parallel Link Mechanism and replace the tires with Airless Tires for improved
traction on the ground.
